# How to install skins after the new steam update

## Pre-requisites

!!! Download the [!badge target="blank" variant="info" text="latest SFP release"](https://github.com/PhantomGamers/SFP/releases)
[!badge target="blank" variant="info" text="Windows"](https://github.com/PhantomGamers/SFP/releases/latest/download/SFP_UI-win10-x64-SelfContained.zip) [!badge target="blank" variant="info" text="Linux"](https://github.com/PhantomGamers/SFP/releases/latest/download/SFP_UI-linux-x64-SelfContained.tar.gz) [!badge target="blank" variant="info" text="Mac"](https://github.com/PhantomGamers/SFP/releases/latest/download/SFP_UI-osx-x64-SelfContained.tar.gz) [!badge text="Recommended"]

!!! Or download Millennium!, download it for [!badge target="blank" variant="info" text="Windows"](https://github.com/ShadowMonster99/millennium-steam-patcher/releases/latest)
Millennium and SFP share many similarities and are fully forward compatible! The main difference is that Millennium doesn't run in a standalone process, but is limited to Windows only.
